### Tasks

Here are some tasks for you to work on:

ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Implement the following User Story with tests.

`User Story: As a user, I want to use the Book Manager API to delete a book using its ID`
If the book Id doesn't exist, send status 404 and message stating the book id was not found
If the book id exists then delete the book and send status 200 with a message stating the book was successfully deleted

ðŸ“˜ Extension Task: Oh no! ðŸ˜­ We've only covered the happy paths in the solution, can you figure out a way
to add in exception handling to the project?

-   Clue 1: What if someone wants to add a book with an ID for a book that already exists? How do we handle this gracefully?
    Send a message to the user stating the book already exists with status code 400

    If ths user sends invalid book details, then send a response message to the user stating the book details are invalid with status code 400

-   Clue 2: What if someone wants to find a book by an ID that doesn't yet exist?
    If the book Id doesn't exist, send status 404 and message stating the book id was not found

    How can we improve the API by handling errors gracefully and show a helpful message to the client?
    If a particular error occurs, we can send appropriate messages on the response.
